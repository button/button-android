## Integrate

### Gradle

We highly recommend that you use our SDK with Gradle, simply add our repository to your project and this dependency.

```
repositories {
    maven {
        url  "http://dl.bintray.com/button/Public" 
    }
}
```

Latest version: ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/button/Public/android-sdk/images/download.svg).

```
dependencies {
    // Add the Button SDK to your app, 
    // you can see the latest version in the badge above
    // Replace + with this number, e.g. 1.0.0
    compile 'com.usebutton:android-sdk:+'
}
```

### Manually

But you can also include us manually by dropping our `aar` into you `/libs` folder, click [ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/button/Public/android-sdk/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/button/Public/android-sdk/_latestVersion) to get the latest version.
