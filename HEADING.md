## Download
We highly recommend that you use our SDK with Gradle, simply add this dependency and make sure you jave `jcenter()` as one of the repositories in your project.

```
dependencies {
	// Add the Button SDK to your app
	compile 'com.usebutton:android-sdk:+'
}
```

But you can also include us manually by dropping our `aar` into you `/libs` folder, click Download to get the latest version.
