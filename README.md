<h1 align="center">Button Android SDK</h1>

Button is the partnerships platform for mobile commerce. Button powers mobile partnerships that are faster, simpler, and perform better.

## Overview

[Button Purchase Path](https://developer.usebutton.com/guides/publishers/android/create-a-button-purchase-path) takes regular Merchant URLs to products, categories or just the homepage and replaces them with a fully attributed Button Purchase Path, optimized for both conversion and user experience.

## Getting started

### Gradle

We highly recommend that you use our SDK with Gradle, all you need to do is make sure you have `mavenCentral()` as one of your app's repositories.

```groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
```
#### Latest Version
[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.usebutton/android-sdk.svg?label=Maven%20Central)](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:%22com.usebutton%22%20AND%20a:%22android-sdk%22)

```groovy
dependencies {
    // Replace 6+ with the latest SDK version found above
    implementation 'com.usebutton:android-sdk:6+'
}
```
