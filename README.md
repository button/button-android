<h1 align="center">Button Android SDK</h1>

Button is the partnerships platform for mobile commerce. Button powers mobile partnerships that are faster, simpler, and perform better.

## Overview

[Button Actions](https://developer.usebutton.com/guides/publishers/android/using-button-actions) provide relevant actions to your users, complete with a corresponding UI. Buttons can be configured with one or more Merchants that they can offer to your users.

[Button Purchase Path](https://developer.usebutton.com/guides/publishers/android/create-a-button-purchase-path) takes regular Merchant URLs to products, categories or just the homepage and replaces them with a fully attributed Button Purchase Path, optimized for both conversion and user experience.

## Getting started

### Gradle

We highly recommend that you use our SDK with Gradle, all you need to do is make sure you have `jcenter()` as one of your app's repositories.

```groovy
repositories {
    jcenter()
}
```
#### Latest Version
![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/button/Public/android-sdk/images/download.svg).

    // Replace 5+ with the latest SDK version found above
    compile 'com.usebutton:android-sdk:5+'
}
```
